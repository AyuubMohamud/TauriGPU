Integer instructions:
P = opcode field bits
X = dest register field bits
I = immediate bit (high on immediate instruction)
S = source register field bits (from bank A)
O = operand 2 field bits -> 11 bit signed immediate, second source register (from bank B)

Floating point instructions:
P = opcode field bits
X = dest register field bits
I = immediate bit (high on immediate instruction)
S = source register field bits (from bank A)
O = operand 2 field bits -> second source register (from bank B for integer register or a floating point register from either bank)
Z = don't care

Bank A    Bank B
Bank = 32 registers
You can read from Bank A
You can read from Bank B
In one cycle
But you can never read twice from the same one
